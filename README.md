# Simplack-Interpreter
A little Python Interpreter for my esolang called Simplack (See  https://esolangs.org/wiki/Simplack).

## Quick Summary
Simplack is a stack-based esolang I made. Simplack stands for Simple and Stack-based. It's designed to be easy to learn. There is 1 stack in Simplack that can have infinite items. Only integers may be stored although they can be output as ASCII characters.

## Setup
You will need Python 3.5 (Or up?) and some kind of command line that you can run the interpreter from.<br>
Simply download the from the master branch and do something like
```
cd C:/MyDirectory/Folders/MoreFolders/Simplack-Interpreter/main/
```
To go to the directory and to run it, simply type
```
interpreter.py myprogram.txt
```
Where myprogram.txt is the program you wish to run.
